Accordingly, we must let technology play a supporting role.\n\nA person practicing domain-driven design does not attempt to model reality. Instead, domain experts and software practitioners use a mental model as a tool for solving problems within a given domain. The domain experts and software practitioners collaborate to explore and develop this model. We will look at the concept of a bounded context within which models can be isolated and explored. We will talk about domain-driven design's building block patterns including entities, value objects, aggregates, repositories, services, and domain events. We will see how test-driven development can be used as a means of exploring the model.",

Lambda expressions require you understand closures and their impact on local variables. You'll also see how lambda expressions can simplify code and open up more functional approaches to writing code. Moving on to generics, you'll see generic inheritance hierarchies, static fields in generic classes, and overloading rules. Tackling LINQ, the talk offers a quick overview of selection and filtering syntax and then dives into powerful set manipulation tools, data transformations, improved XML techniques, and LINQ-friendly extension methods. Touching on the new async behavior in .NET 4.5 you'll learn about an unexpected quirk in exception handling. The talk closes out with quick excursions into code contracts to improve reliability, tuples to simplify complex lists and arrays, and dynamic variables to simplify accessing external libraries.

Before each principle is applied and the solution is refactored to introduce it, the attendee is presented with one or two simple PowerPoint slides to introduce the concept and provide some abstract understanding of its goals and benefits to OO programming. The principle is then applied to the existing solution, demonstrating the practical application of the principle to working software. At each step along the way, the existing solution (a simple console application) is re-executed, demonstrating that the overall behavior of the software solution has not been negatively impacted by the various refactorings.",
